# hello-world
I built a SCADA system using Arduino & 8 XBee modules to control a spring-fed domestic drinking water system
It's time to modify that system to communicate over the phone and chart in a standard spreadsheet format.
Right now, I am just learning how to get control over github so that I can publish modules that do cool stuff.
Lots of accelerometers and temp sensors reporting to a remote site for analysis.I don't have to throw switches, open valves, or calculate a number of squirts to inject chlorine.
All I gotta do is read a bunch of sensor groups, filter out the noise, and compare the results with other wind turbines; at that point identify the anomolies.
